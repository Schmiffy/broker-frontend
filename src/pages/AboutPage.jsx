        <h1>What is Bro-ker?</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Bro-ker</strong> is a sleek, modern, and privacy-focused portfolio tracker. It's designed for investors who want to monitor their stock holdings without giving their data away to large corporations.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul className="features-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Your Data, Your Browser:</strong> Your entire portfolio is stored securely in your browser's local storage. Nothing is ever sent to a server, ensuring complete privacy. If you clear your browser data, your portfolio will be gone, so be mindful!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-Time* Data:</strong> The app fetches near real-time stock prices and the latest company news from a reliable financial data API. Data is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds to keep you up-to-date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>At-a-Glance Insights:</strong> The dashboard provides a clear overview of your holdings, including quantity, average cost, current value, and your total profit or loss for each position, both in absolute and percentage terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay Informed:</strong> A dedicated news widget aggregates the latest headlines for the specific stocks in your portfolio, helping you stay on top of market-moving events.
          </li>
        </ul>
